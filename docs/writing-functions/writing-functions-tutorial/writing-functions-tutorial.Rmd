## Automating Plot Generation

### Some HIV data

I've saved a data set (originally from GapMinder) that has information on HIV
prevelance by country over time. I've saved the data at
[http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/data/HIVdata.csv]("http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/data/HIVdata.csv"), 
so we can skip the clean up for now and focus on the plot.

```{r, read-hiv, exercise = TRUE}
# read data from the web
HIVdata <- 
  readr::read_csv(
    "http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/data/HIVdata.csv"
  )   
head(HIVdata, 3)
```


### An HIV plot

Here's a plot we made can make with this data.

```{r, plot1, exercise = TRUE}
HIVdata %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Uganda", "Kenya", "Tanzania", "South Africa",
                        "Zimbabwe", "United States")) %>%
  filter(year > 1988) %>%
  mutate(country = 
           reorder(country, HIV.perc, 
                   function(x) - max(x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
  gf_line(HIV.perc ~ year, color = ~ country, size = 2, alpha = 0.5) 
```

**Note:** I've added one new feature to the plot.  I've reordered the levels 
of `country` so that the lines in the legend are in roughly the same order as the
lines on the plot.  This can make it easier to read the plot.  The `reorder()` function
is a handy tool to have for adjusting the oder of things on plots.


## A first function

Now let's turn this into a simple (and not particularly useful) function.  The general outline 
for defining a function is

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_function_name <- function ( argument1, arguemnt2, ...) {

  # stuff to do 
  
}
```

#### Exercise

Edit the code below by adding one line at the top and one line at the bottom

  * top: `HIVplot <- function () {`
  
    * This says we are creating a function and naming it `HIVplot`.
    * The arguments to the function go inside `(` and `)` -- this function doesn't have any yet, but we will be 
    adding some shortly.
    * The code defining the function will go between `{` and `}`.
  * bottom: `}`
    * This let's R know that we are done with our function definition.
    * By default, the object created by the last expression in the function body is returned -- 
    in this case, the plot.  This is the "result" of the function.

```{r, first-function, exercise = TRUE}
  HIVdata %>%
    filter(country %in% c("Uganda", "Kenya", "Tanzania", "South Africa",
                          "Zimbabwe", "United States")) %>%
    filter(year > 1988) %>%
    mutate(country = 
             reorder(country, HIV.perc, 
                     function(x) - max(x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
    gf_line(HIV.perc ~ year, color = ~country, size = 2, alpha = 0.5)
```

```{r, first-function-solution}
HIVplot <- function() {
  HIVdata %>%
    filter(country %in% c("Uganda", "Kenya", "Tanzania", "South Africa",
                          "Zimbabwe", "United States")) %>%
    filter(year > 1988) %>%
    mutate(country = 
             reorder(country, HIV.perc, 
                     function(x) - max(x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
    gf_line(HIV.perc ~ year, color = ~country, size = 2, alpha = 0.5)
}
```


As is, the funciton is not so useful, becuase it doesn't have any
arguments, so it can only create the same plot repeatedly.  But even
this can be useful for tasks that you want to repeat frequently in exactly
the same way -- it can save a lot of typing:

```{r, a-plot, exercise.setup = "first-function-solution", exercise = TRUE}
# HIVplot() is loaded from the solution to the previous exercise
HIVplot()
```

## Function arguments

### Our first argument

We can generalize this by adding some arguments that let us 
change features of the plot.  For example, we could add the abilty
to adjust the width of the lines as follows:

```{r, HIVplot2, exercise = TRUE}
HIVplot2 <- function(linewidth = 2) {
  HIVdata %>%
    filter(country %in% c("Uganda", "Kenya", "Tanzania", "South Africa",
                          "Zimbabwe", "United States")) %>%
    filter(year > 1988) %>%
    mutate(country = 
             reorder(country, HIV.perc, 
                     function(x) - max(x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
    gf_line(HIV.perc ~ year, color = ~country, size = linewidth, alpha = 0.5)
}
HIVplot2(linewidth = 1)
```

### Additional arguments

In a similar way, we can add several arguments to our function.  Let's
add the following:

 * `data`: the name of our data set (in case we have data with a different name later)
 * `indicator`: the name of the column that contains the data to be plotted against
     time.  GapMinder calls these indicators, so we are borrowing their terminology.
     (As a fancy bonus, we'll call `match.arg()` to allow for abbreviation of the
     name.)
 * `countries`: the countries we want to display
 * `linewidth`: the thickness of the lines that we draw
 * `first_year`: the first year we want to display
 * `opacity`: how opaque the lines are (between 0 and 1)

Below we create a function with these arguments, and then
in the body of the function, plug them in in the appropriate places.

Here are few things to know about the new function definition.

 1. Default values of the the arguments can be specified in the function
declaration.  That way, we don't have to provide a value for 
every argument.  Argument names can be specified by (unique prefix of)
name or by position.  It is a common practice in R to use the
first arguement or two without names and then to use names for the 
other arguments, which will typically have default values so that only
those being overridden need to be specified.

 2. Because our indicator variable is described by a character string, we need 
 to do some work to create our formula. We'll also add a bit of fancy stuff.
 
   * The default value will be the third variable in the data set (because GapMinder
   data typically comes with the interesting variable there).
   
   * We will use `match.arg()` to do prefix matching on the names in the data
   set, so we can be lazy and only type the first few characters.

 3. Our new function can plot time series for any data that has columns named
`country` and `year` and an additional column containing the "indicator" to be 
plotted.  So we should give the function a name that reflects this generality.
We could call it `GapminderPlot()`, since it is designed to work with 
GapMinder data sets, or we could name it `TimeSeriesPlot()`, although it is
not very flexibly designed for arbitrary time series data.

 4. We could make this even more general if we allowed column names to 
 be specified for `country` and `year` as well as `indicator`.  Deciding how
 general to make a function is an important part of the design.  Often
 you will return to functions later to make them more general becuase you
 find that they almost do some other task you didn't think of when you originally
 wrote the function.

```{r, gapminderplot-copy} 
GapMinderPlot <- 
  function( 
    data, 
    indicator = names(data)[3],
    countries = c( "South Africa", "Zimbabwe", "United States"),
    linewidth = 1.2,
    first_year = min(~year, data = data, na.rm = TRUE),
    opacity = .8
    ) {
  indicator <- match.arg(indicator, names(data))
  formula <- as.formula( paste( indicator, "~", "year") )
  data %>%
    filter(country %in% countries) %>%
    filter(year >= first_year) %>%
    gf_line(formula, color = ~country, size = linewidth, alpha = opacity)
  }
```

```{r, gapminderplot} 
GapMinderPlot <- 
  function( 
    data, 
    indicator = names(data)[3],
    countries = c( "South Africa", "Zimbabwe", "United States"),
    linewidth = 1.2,
    first_year = min(~year, data = data, na.rm = TRUE),
    opacity = .8
    )  {
  indicator <- match.arg(indicator, names(data))
  formula <- as.formula( paste( indicator, "~", "year") )
  data %>%
    filter(country %in% countries) %>%
    filter(year >= first_year) %>%
    gf_line(formula, color = ~country, size = linewidth, alpha = opacity)
  }
```



```{r, gapminder-plot-evaluate, exercise.setup = "gapminderplot", exercise = TRUE}
GapMinderPlot( HIVdata, linewidth = 4)
GapMinderPlot( HIVdata, 
               countries = c("United States", "South Africa", "Kenya"),
               first_year = 1990,
               linewidth = 1) 
```


We have lost one feature in this version.  We have lost the reordering of the
countries.  This can be reintroduced, but it is tricky to do it with mutate since 
we don't know the name of the variable to be reordered when we are writing the 
function.  (It is determined by the user's value of `indicator`, which is a character
string.)  Below is one way to do it.

While we are at it, let's make the
default value of `indicator` be the name of the third column of `data` (where it will
be located if the data are processed from GapMinder the way we have done it).

```{r, GapMinderPlot2, exercise = TRUE}
GapMinderPlot <- 
  function( 
    data, 
    indicator = names(data)[3], 
    countries = c( "South Africa", "Zimbabwe", "United States"),
    linewidth = 1.2,
    first_year = min(~year, data = data, na.rm = TRUE),
    opacity = .8
    ) 
    {

  # this finds indicator among the names of the variables even if it is abbreviated
  # to a unique prefix.
  indicator <- match.arg(indicator, names(data)) 
  formula <- as.formula( paste( indicator, "~", "year") )
  
  data <- 
    data %>%
    filter(country %in% countries) 
  
  data[["country"]] <-
     reorder(data[["country"]], data[[indicator]], function(x) - max(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  
  data %>%
    filter(year >= first_year) %>%
    gf_line(formula, color = ~country, size = linewidth, alpha = opacity)
  }

# adjust the entries here to try out some different plots

GapMinderPlot( HIVdata,
               countries = c("United States", "South Africa", "Kenya"),
               first_year = 1990,
               linewidth = 1) 
```

## A function to load data

Now let's create a function that can read in data from a GapMinder
spreadhseet and reformat the resutling data so that is is glyph
ready for our plot.  The details here are less important than the overall
structure:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
load_gapminder <- function(
  url,             # URL for the GoogleSheet
  name = "value"   # name for "indicator" variable
  ) {
  # code to use googlesheets to fetch the data
  # code to tidy up the data for plotting
}
```

Here's the function with the details filled in.  (For more about the 
googlesheets package, visit the 
[googlesheets GitHub page](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets).)

```{r}
require(googlesheets)
load_gapminder <- function(url, name = "value") {
  google_connection <- gs_url( url, visibility = "public" )
  
  # using the dimensions of the spread sheet, read the portion
  # that contains data.  Specifying the range should not be necessary
  # for newer google sheets.
  result <-
    gs_read(google_connection,
            range = cell_limits(c(1,1),
                                c(google_connection$ws$row_extent[1],
                                  google_connection$ws$col_extent[1]))
    ) 
  
  # name the first column country
  names(result)[1] <- "country"
 
  # convert from wide to long format 
  result <- 
    result %>% 
    gather( year, value, -country ) %>% 
    mutate( year = extract_numeric(year))
  
  # rename the indicator column
  names(result)[3] <- name
  result    # returned value since it is the last line evaluated
}
```

```{r load-plot}
require(googlesheets)
load_gapminder <- function( url, name = "value") {
  google_connection <- gs_url( url, visibility = "public" )
  
  # using the dimensions of the spread sheet, read the portion
  # that contains data.  Specifying the range should not be necessary
  # for newer google sheets.
  result <-
    gs_read(google_connection,
            range = cell_limits(c(1,1),
                                c(google_connection$ws$row_extent[1],
                                  google_connection$ws$col_extent[1]))
    ) 
  
  # name the first column country
  names(result)[1] <- "country"
 
  # convert from wide to long format 
  result <- 
    result %>% 
    gather( year, value, -country ) %>% 
    mutate( year = extract_numeric(year))
  
  # rename the indicator column
  names(result)[3] <- name
  result    # returned value since it is the last line evaluated
}

GapMinderPlot <- 
  function( 
    data, 
    indicator = names(data)[3], 
    countries = c( "South Africa", "Zimbabwe", "United States"),
    linewidth = 1.2,
    first_year = min(~year, data = data, na.rm = TRUE),
    opacity = .8
    ) 
    {

  # this finds indicator among the names of the variables even if it is abbreviated
  # to a unique prefix.
  indicator <- match.arg(indicator, names(data)) 
  formula <- as.formula( paste( indicator, "~", "year") )
  
  data <- 
    data %>%
    filter(country %in% countries) 
  
  data[["country"]] <-
     reorder(data[["country"]], data[[indicator]], function(x) - max(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  
  data %>%
    filter(year >= first_year) %>%
    gf_line(formula, color = ~country, size = linewidth, alpha = opacity)
  }
```

With that function in hand, it is easy to read data once we determine the google 
URL for the sheet.  Here's how we load our HIV data directly from Google.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hiv_url <- 
  "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kWH_xdJDM4SMfT_Kzpkk-1yuxWChfurZuWYjfmv51EA/pub?gid=0"
HIVdata2 <- load_gapminder(hiv_url, name = "HIV.perc")
GapMinderPlot(HIVdata2)
```

We can load other GapMinder spreadsheets by supplying a different URL.
Here is life expectency data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
le_url <-
  "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H3nzTwbn8z4lJ5gJ_WfDgCeGEXK3PVGcNjQ_U5og8eo/pub?gid=0"
LifeExpectency <- load_gapminder( le_url, name = "life.expectancy" ) 
```


We can now use our plotting function with any of these data sets.

#### Exercise

Adjust the arguments of this function call to change the plot.

 * change the starting date
 * change the countries
 * change the size of teh lines
 * make any other changes that you like.

```{r, two-plots, exercise.setup = "load-plot", exercise = TRUE}
GapMinderPlot(
  LifeExpectency, 
  countries = c("Germany", "United States", "New Zealand", "China", "India", "Japan"))
GapMinderPlot(LifeExpectency)
```

### The plot is returned, not printed

`GapMinderPlot()` does not print a plot, it **returns** the plot.  By default,
when RStudio receives a plot, it prints it out.  But we don't have to print it.
We could instead store it in a variable, or modify it just like we can any other 
gg object.  Here's an example.


```{r, two-plot-refine, exercise.setup = "load-plot", exercise = TRUE}
GapMinderPlot(
  LifeExpectency, opacity=0.5, 
  countries=c("United States", "Germany", "South Africa") ) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Life Expectency", x = "Year", title = "Life Expectency Over Time") %>%
  gf_theme(theme_bw()) %>%
  gf_refine(annotate("text", x= 1863, y=45, label = "Civil War")) %>%
  gf_refine(annotate("text", x= 1916, y=64, label = "WWW 1")) %>%
  gf_refine(annotate("text", x= 1942, y=76, label = "WWW 2")) 
```

## The Big Picture

 1. If you find yourself wanting to copy a chunk of code, make one little change, and then run it again, then you are likely in a situation where a function would be useful.
 
 2. You can begin your function by wrapping your code chunk in 
 
```r
my_function_name <- function () {

  # old code goes here
  
}
```

 3. Now choose one small thing that you would like to be able to vary.  Provide 
 a name for the argument and a default value (if there is a reasonable default) and
 replace the specific value in your code with the argument name from your 
 function declaration.
 
 4. Keep an eye out for ways you could make your function more general than your 
 immediate task.  Not only does that make your function more widely useful, but 
 often the function is easier to write, and clearer to read if it is a bit more general.
 
 5. But build up slowly.  Don't go crazy with 27 complicated options all at once.
 You can add in new arguments one at a time or in small groups of arguments that 
 work together.
 
 6. If your function will be useful in multiple files or projects, you should
 consider putting it into a package.  Simple packages created for your own use
 are not that hard to build.  Once you have made your package, you can simply
 `require()` it in any file or project where you want to use your new function.
 It is also easy to share packages with others who might be interested in using
 your function.
 
 7. Comment your code.  Don't write comments for simple code that is clear by itself, but do write comments 
   * for complicated code where it might not be immediately clear what is happening
   * explaining **why** you are doing things
   * outlining the **big picture** (how you are thinking about the task at hand)
   * alerting the reader to subtleties (or with students, unfamiliar functions or
   new features of the langauge.)
   
8. But don't confuse comments with text that belongs in a proper document.

## Exercises

 1. Make `GapMinderPlot` more general by allowing the user to select columns rather
 than requiring that they be called `country` and `year`.
 
 2. Write a data loading function for a kind of data you expect to encounter 
 frequently.
 
 3. Write a plotting function for a kind of plot you anticipate making frequently.
