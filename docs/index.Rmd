## RStudio set-up

To take full advantage of the workshop, you will want to have
working, up-to-date versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). There are at least three
options for achieving this:
    
* **Install them locally on your laptop.** Installation is
straightforward. Follow the links above to find download 
and installation instructions for your platform.
   
* **Use an RStudio server account** and work in a browser. If you don't
already have a server account, I can provide one during the workshop, or you
can use the third option.
    
* **Use [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud).** You can set
up a free account.
    
If your R set-up is rather old, I recommend updating R, RStudio, and your 
R packages.

## Less Volume, More Creativity

### A guiding principle

* [Slides]()

### Example: An introduction to R/RStudio/ggformula

* [Tutorial]()
* [Graphics Gallery](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nl3XHQGbYPeG_mf4aBBGaEFDKGerABc3AvuZNA7PsnM/edit?usp=sharing)

### More R Examples

* [Examples and Tutorials @ Calvin](http://rsconnect.calvin.edu:3939/connect/#/apps/94/access) [Mostly assembled by Stacy DeRuiter for Intro Biostats]

## R Markdown -- Creating documents in RStudio

### Getting Started with R Markdown 

* [Slides](rmarkdown/rmarkdown-slides.html)
* [Rmd](rmarkdown/rmarkdown-slides.Rmd)

### Variations on the theme

* [learnr tutorials]() -- for interactive documents with live R code blocks 
* [presentations]() -- HTML, PDF, or even PowerPoint slides
* [bookdown]() for "books"
* [blogdown]() for websites

## Data

### Tidy data

* [Tidy Data Slides]()

### Getting data into R

R and various packages provide tools for importing data from many different
types of file (csv, Excel, SPSS, SAS, google spreadsheets, etc.)

## Data Wrangling with the tidyverse

### 5.5 Data verbs to get you started

### Combining data from multiple sources -- joins

### Pivoting -- pivot tables the R way

### Cleaning up other messes

* [TB case study]()
    * data in variables -- pivoting +  `tidyr::separate()` 
* dates -- lubridate to the rescue
* extracting numbers -- `readr::parse_number()` to the rescue

## Writing functions in R

## Using Github with RStudio

## Creating an R package

* [Making an R package with RStudio and GitHub](http://rpruim.github.io/talks/R-Packages/R-packages-slides.html)

## Maps

* easy maps with leaflet 

## Modeling

* lm(), glm(), lmer(), etc.
* machine learning in R 
* Bayesian inference in R
